                687 "No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God." Now God's Spirit, who reveals God, makes known to us Christ, his Word, his living Utterance, but the Spirit does not speak of himself. The Spirit who "has spoken through the prophets" makes us hear the Father's Word, but we do not hear the Spirit himself. We know him only in the movement by which he reveals the Word to us and disposes us to welcome him in faith. the Spirit of truth who "unveils" Christ to us "will not speak on his own." Such properly divine self-effacement explains why "the world cannot receive (him), because it neither sees him nor knows him," while those who believe in Christ know the Spirit because he dwells with them.<br/>

                688 The Church, a communion living in the faith of the apostles which she transmits, is the place where we know the Holy Spirit: <br/>
                - in the Scriptures he inspired; <br/>
                - in the Tradition, to which the Church Fathers are always timely witnesses; <br/>
                - in the Church's Magisterium, which he assists; <br/>
                - in the sacramental liturgy, through its words and symbols, in which the Holy Spirit puts us into communion with Christ; <br/>
                - in prayer, wherein he intercedes for us; <br/>
                - in the charisms and ministries by which the Church is built up; <br/>
                - in the signs of apostolic and missionary life; <br/>
                - in the witness of saints through whom he manifests his holiness and continues the work of salvation.<br/><br/>
                <br/>
                I. The Joint Mission of the Son and the Spirit<br/>
                689 The One whom the Father has sent into our hearts, the Spirit of his Son, is truly God.10 Consubstantial with the Father and the Son, the Spirit is inseparable from them, in both the inner life of the Trinity and his gift of love for the world. In adoring the Holy Trinity, life-giving, consubstantial, and indivisible, the Church's faith also professes the distinction of persons. When the Father sends his Word, he always sends his Breath. In their joint mission, the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct but inseparable. To be sure, it is Christ who is seen, the visible image of the invisible God, but it is the Spirit who reveals him.
